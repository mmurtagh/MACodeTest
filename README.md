# MACodeTest
Market America Code Test - Matthew Murtagh

## Summary

For the coding test, I created a small interactive game using the shop.com search and product API. The user is presented with 10 questions about random products on shop.com and prompted to guess whether or not the actual value of the product is higher or lower than a presented value.
  
After answering, the user can see if they were correct, what the actual price was, and has an opportunity to open the product in question directly on shop.com. At the end of the game, the user can see their results, return to the main menu, and play another game.
  
## Target Platform

The application, while built in react native, was only tested and designed to be an Android application. The target Android SDK is version 26 (8.0.0 Oreo) while the minimum SDK version is 16 (4.1.X Jelly Bean).
