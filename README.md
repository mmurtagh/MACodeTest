Market America Code Test - Matthew Murtagh

## Summary

  For the coding test, I created a small interactive game using the shop.com search and product API. The user is presented with 10 questions about a random products on shop.com and prompted to guess whether or not the actual value of the product is higher or lower than a presented value.
  
  After answering, the user can see if they were correct, what the actual price was, and has an opportunity to open the product in question directly on shop.com
